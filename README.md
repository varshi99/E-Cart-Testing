## Overview

This project documents the end-to-end manual testing process for a sample software application.
It follows the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) and includes all major QA documentation artifacts such as requirements, test plans, test cases, bug reports, traceability matrix, and test execution results.

This project is designed to demonstrate manual testing skills and professional QA documentation for portfolio purposes.

##Documents Description
###1. FRS (Functional Requirements Specification)

Contains functional and non-functional requirements of the application.

Acts as the source for designing test scenarios and test cases.

###2. Test Plan

Outlines the testing scope, objectives, approach, and schedule.

Includes resources, risks, and deliverables.

###3. Test Scenarios

High-level descriptions of what features/modules will be tested.

Helps ensure coverage of all requirements before writing detailed test cases.

###4. Test Cases

Detailed test cases with:

Test Case ID

Description

Steps to execute

Expected result

Actual result

Pass/Fail status

###5. Bug Report

Contains the list of defects identified during execution with:

Bug ID

Severity

Priority

Steps to reproduce

Status

###6. RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)

Links each requirement with its corresponding test cases to ensure complete coverage.

###7. Test Execution Results

Logs the execution status (Pass/Fail) for each test case.

##Tools & Skills Demonstrated

## Sample Test Case Table
Test Case ID	Description	Steps to Execute	Expected Result	Status
TC_001	Verify login function	Enter valid credentials & submit	User is logged in	Pass
TC_002	Invalid password test	Enter invalid password & submit	Error message displayed	Pass
ðŸš€ How to Use This Project

Open FRS to understand the scope and requirements.

Review the Test Plan for the testing approach.

Check Test Scenarios and Test Cases for execution steps.

Execute tests and log defects in the Bug Report.

Refer to the RTM to verify requirement coverage.

Review Test Execution Results for the final test outcomes.
